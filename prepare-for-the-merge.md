# Guide on how to prepare a staking machine for the Merge

[The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) is a protocol upgrade that is being rolled out on all Ethereum networks being kept around. This procotol upgrade will be rolled out on mainnet and Ethereum validators will need to take some measures and some actions to make sure their staking machine will work during this upgrade and that they will keep running well after the upgrade. Tests are already underway and [the Merge upgrade has been applied to testnets](https://wenmerge.com/) already.

This guide is meant for people who are managing and maintaining staking machines. It will explain which steps or actions you should take in order to be ready for the Merge.

## Why would you want to prepare for the Merge?

There are some risks your staking machine will stop performing its duties if you are not well prepared. There are some risks your Ethereum validator will miss some rewards if you are not well prepared.

## When is the Merge going to happen on Mainnet?

The current planned date for the Merge protocol upgrade to happen is ~Q3/Q4 2022. There is some uncertainty around the actual date it will happen. Make sure to follow [the official Ethereum blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/) and watch for announcements there.
