# Guide on how to join the merge-devnet-3

*#TestingTheMerge* is an Ethereum community initiative to test [the merge upgrade](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/merge/) with various testnets. It is being spear headed by [Marius van der Wijden](https://twitter.com/vdWijden) and [Parithosh Jayanthi](https://twitter.com/parithosh_j). It is meant to test the recent experimental features added to various Ethereum clients supporting this protocol upgrade.

This guide is meant for people with some experience in running Ethereum clients and using the command-line interface (CLI). It will show you step by step how to setup your machine to join the *merge-devnet-3* by giving you the instructions to install and configure all the tools needed. It will assume you are using a modern linux distribution with systemd and APT (like Ubuntu 20.04, but it should work on most recent debian derivatives) on a modern x86 CPU (Intel, AMD). A clean install of your operating system on a dedicated machine or a virtual machine before proceeding is preferable.

## Overview

We will build special versions of Geth and Lighthouse and we will configure them to connect to the *merge-devnet-3* testnet.

## Executing the commands

Almost all of these commands will be performed in a terminal. Start your *Terminal* application. Any line that starts with the dollar sign (`$`) is a command that need to be executed in your terminal. Do not input the dollar sign (`$`) in your terminal, only the text that comes after that.

Executing a command with `sudo` will occasionally ask you for your password. Make sure to enter your account password correctly. You can execute the command again if you fail to enter the correct password.

## Installing Prerequisites

Make sure we have fully updated packages first.

```console
$ sudo apt -y update
$ sudo apt -y upgrade
```

Install prerequisites commonly available.

```console
$ sudo apt -y install git build-essential cmake wget curl
```

Install a recent version of go.

```console
$ wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.17.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
$ echo 'PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin"' >> ~/.profile
$ rm go1.17.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Install a recent version of rust.

```console
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Type `1` and `Enter` to select option 1 *Proceed with installation (default)*.

Add the rust toolchains to your path.

```console
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## Building and Installing Geth merge-devnet-4

Clone Marius van der Wijden's Geth repository and switch to the `merge-devnet-4` branch.

```console
$ cd ~
$ git clone -b merge-devnet-4 https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/go-ethereum.git
```

Build this special Geth version.

```console
$ cd go-ethereum
$ make geth
```

Wait for building to finish and install this special Geth version globally.

```console
$ sudo cp ./build/bin/geth /usr/local/bin
$ cd ~
```

## Building and Installing Lighthouse kintsugi

Clone the official Lighthouse repository and switch to the `kintsugi` branch.

```console
$ cd ~
$ git clone -b kintsugi https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse.git
```

Build this special Lighthouse version.

```console
$ cd lighthouse
$ make
```

Wait for building to finish and install this special Lighthouse version globally.

```console
$ sudo cp ~/.cargo/bin/lighthouse /usr/local/bin
$ cd ~
```

## Initializing and configuring your Geth node

**TODO**

## What's next?

You might want to try some transactions using MetaMask on this testnet. If so, check out [Marius van der Wijden's guide](https://hackmd.io/dFzKxB3ISWO8juUqPpJFfw#Setting-up-Metamask).
